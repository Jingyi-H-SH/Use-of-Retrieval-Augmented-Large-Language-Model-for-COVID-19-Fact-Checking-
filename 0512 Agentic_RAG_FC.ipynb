       "1      Objectives: Young adults have been overly affected by the containment measures against COVID-19 and, consequently, worsening in mental health and change in health behavior have been reported. Because the life phase of emerging adulthood is crucial for developing health behaviors, this study aims to examine increase in alcohol consumption, single and multiple binge drinking, and associated factors in students during lockdown and post-lockdown periods. Methods: A prospective open cohort study design with nine survey time points between April 2020 and June 2021 was conducted. The present study uses pooled data from the first survey T0 (3 April to 14 April) and follow-ups at T1 (30 April to ...   \n",

However, despite the vaccines, 5 to 10% of the patients with mild disease develop moderate to critical forms with potential lethal evolution. In addition to assess lung infection spread, chest CT helps to detect complications. Developing a prediction model to identify at-risk patients of worsening from mild COVID-19 combining simple clinical and biological parameters with qualitative or quantitative data using CT would be relevant to organizing optimal patient management. Methods: Four French hospitals were used for model training and internal validation. External validation was conducted in two independent hospitals. We used easy-...   \n",

Therefore, we use bibliometric analysis on COVID-19 and olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction publications to provide studies perspective.

       "4      Background: The term “human microbiota” refers to populations of microorganisms that live harmoniously in co-existence with humans. They contribute significantly to the host's immunological response when confronted with a respiratory viral infection. However, little is known about the relationship between the human microbiome and COVID-19. Therefore, our objective is to perform a bibliometric analysis to explore the overall structure and hotspots of research activity on the links between microbiota and COVID-19 at the global level.

Early on, a local group of researchers united to investigate the impact of the pandemic on pediatric hematology oncology (PHO). From this group, a regional educational series was established, “virtual-Symposium of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology of New York” (v-SYMPHONY). The implementation of these endeavors while PHO fellowship applications are declining has highlighted our perceptions that education, mentoring, and career expectations are not keeping up with the needs of current trainees.

       "[\"The claim is true. High-contact surfaces in public places are indeed low-risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as suggested in the studies by 'I. J. Onakpoya; C. J. Heneghan; E. A. Spencer; J. Brassey; A. Plüddemann; D. H. Evans; J. M. Conly; T. Jefferson2021SARS-CoV-2 and the role of fomite transmission: a systematic review' and 'L. Gavaldà-Mestre; D. Ramírez-Tarruella; C. Gutiérrez-Milla; F. Guillamet-Roig; R. Orriols-Ramos; S. R. Tisner; N. Pàrraga-Niño2021Nondetection of SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces of public areas next to COVID-19 hospitalization units.' They found that most studies couldn't recover viable SARS-CoV-2 from such surfaces and SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any sampled high-touch public area next to COVID-19 hospitalization units. These findings suggest low transmission risk.\",\n",
       " 'The claim that SARS-CoV-2 is not transmitted through speech, coughing, or sneezing is false. The context provided in the document authored by L. Comber et al., 2021 titled \"Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols\" suggests that most transmission may occur through aerosols, especially in poorly ventilated environments. The second document by P. Z. Chen et al., 2021 titled \"Heterogeneity in transmissibility and shedding SARS-CoV-2 via droplets and aerosols\" indicates that while some individuals expel little virus, highly infectious individuals can expel a significant number of virus particles.',\n",
       " \"The claim is true. The context provided from documents authored by T. Manabe, D. Kambayashi, H. Akatsu, K. Kudo in 2021, and J. H. McMahon among others in 2022, contains evidence of Favipiravir's efficacy in treating mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The drug has been reported to induce viral clearance, contribute to clinical improvement, and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.\",\n",
       " 'The claim is false. The studies from \"Macrovascular Thrombotic Events in a Mayo Clinic Enterprise-Wide Sample of Hospitalized COVID-19–Positive Compared With COVID-19–Negative Patients\" by authors R. Chaudhary, L. Padrnos, E. Wysokinska, et al., and \"Safety and efficacy of antithrombotics in outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis\" by authors S. A. Ansari, N. Merza, M. Salman, et al., indicated that there is a risk, albeit lower than previously reported, of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients, which contradicts the claim that there\\'s a reduced risk. Additionally, antithrombotic drugs\\' risks and benefits in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms are still not well-established and remain controversial.',\n",
       " 'The documents do not provide a clear link between COVID-19 symptoms and tooth pain or deterioration. The first document details a study about changes in permanent tooth injury in the Xi\\'an area of China during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this cannot definitively confirm if tooth pain or deterioration is a direct symptom of COVID-19 infection [\"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiological characteristics of permanent dental injury in Xi\\'an of China: A retrospective study\" by Y. Yang; Y. Liu; Z. Wang; Q. Li; J. Wang; M. Zhang]. The second document discusses the potential links between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19 outcomes, but again, this doesn\\'t affirm if tooth issues are a direct symptom of the disease [\"Is periodontal disease a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness?\" by V. Pitones-Rubio; E. G. Chávez-Cortez; A. Hurtado-Camarena; A. González-Rascón; N. Serafín-Higuera]. Thus, we cannot definitively state that tooth pain and deterioration are COVID-19 symptoms based on these documents.',\n",
       " 'The claim is false. Studies have demonstrated the importance of using genetic data alongside clinical and socio-demographic factors for a better understanding of severe COVID-19 outcomes. This information is cited from the study titled \"Interplay between demographic, clinical and polygenic risk factors for severe COVID-19\" by S. S. R. Crossfield, N. J. M. Chaddock, M. M. Iles, M. Pujades-Rodriguez, and A. W. Morgan (2022).',\n",
       " 'The claim is partially correct. According to a study by \"A. D. Flaxman; D. J. Henning; H. C. Duber\" titled \"The relative incidence of COVID-19 in healthcare workers versus non-healthcare workers\", the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in healthcare workers than in non-healthcare occupations. However, it should be noted that some reports like the study by \"N. A. Al-zoubi; B. R. Obeidat; M. A. Al-Ghazo\" titled \"Prevalence of positive COVID-19 among asymptomatic health care workers who care patients infected with the novel coronavirus\" suggest that a cautious interpretation is needed. Whether the incidence is \\'high\\' or \\'not high\\' can be very subjective and dependent on context.',\n",
       " 'The claim that alcohol abuse has NOT been identified as a potential risk factor for increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 is false. The study \"Influence of Cigarettes and Alcohol on the Severity and Death of COVID-19: A Multicenter Retrospective Study in Wuhan, China\" by M. Dai et al., 2020, indicates that cigarette smoking is a risk factor, but does not establish a significant effect of alcohol consumption on severe illness or death rates in COVID-19 patients. However, M. A. Bantounou, in the 2023 review \"A narrative review of the use of alcohol during the Covid-19 pandemic; effects and implications,\" suggests that healthcare professionals should counsel people on alcohol misuse, implying a concern for its potential as a risk factor.',\n",

Schmulson, M. F. Dávalos, and J. Berumen, and \"Elucidating symptoms of COVID-19 illness in the Arizona CoVHORT: A longitudinal cohort study\" by S. M. Khan et al. both confirm the existence of such symptoms in COVID-19 cases.',\n",

This is highlighted in the study \"Clinical characteristics of diarrhea in 90 cases with COVID-19: A descriptive study\" by Y.

El-Anwar et al., entitled \"Analysis of ear, nose and throat manifestations in COVID-19 patients\", which points out that nasal congestion and obstruction are common symptoms. Additionally, a study by A. C. Tham et al., called \"Olfactory taste disorder as a presenting symptom of COVID-19: a large single-center Singapore study\", confirms that symptoms of a blocked or runny nose, were exhibited in COVID-19 patients.',\n",

Another study, \"Skin Manifestations Among Patients Admitted with COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study at a University-Based Tertiary Hospital in Jordan\" by D. M. Alshiyab et al., 2023, found various skin manifestations, including worsening of pre-existing skin diseases in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the case report titled \"An itchy erythematous papular skin rash as a possible early sign of COVID-19: a case report\" by A. Serafini et al., 2020, presents a case of a patient developing a skin rash early in the course of COVID-19.']"
